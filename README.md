# About
Gamgee is your sidekick for managing multi-factor authentication tokens. It is a command-line tool
that can be used as a drop-in replacement for Google Authenticator app.

Gamgee implements the TOTP algorithm specified in [RFC6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238)

# Installation
On MacOS, install using homebrew:

```
brew install rkaippully/tools/gamgee
```

# Usage
Gamgee is a replacement for Google Authenticator app or any other similar app providing multi-factor
authentication. Typically, such tools scan a QR code to create an account. Gamgee cannot scan a QR
code, but you can instead get a secret token from your service and add that to Gamgee.

Once you get the secret, create a token with this command:

```
gamgee add -l "<token-label>" -s "<secret>"
```

`token-label` is a convenient label that you choose for this token.

You can find a list of all your tokens with:

```
gamgee list
```

You can also remove a token if it is no longer needed. Please remember that this cannot be undone:

```
gamgee delete -l "<token-label>"
```

Finally, you can generate an OTP for authenticating with your token:

```
gamgee <token-label>
```

This will generate an OTP and copy it to your clipboard. You can paste it into your authentication
service. Alternatively, you can write the OTP to standard output with:

```
gamgee <token-label> --stdout
```
